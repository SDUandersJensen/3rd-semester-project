# 3rd-semester-project
This is some documentation of my 3rd Semester Project Mechanical engineering at South Danish University   The project was a chronograph which could messure the velocity of a bullet, further test and research proff that the arduino was only capable to messure velocity slower projectile, like a nerf toy projectile   the crono was made using Infrared receivers and emitters for sensors   Arduino and C++ for calculations and to obtain the signal   and excel to run statistics on the results.  the arduino source code can be found here: 

int thresh =52;// this is the treshhold

int sens1 = A1; //sensor 1 port
int sens2 =A5; //sensor 2 port
unsigned long Time,Time2; 
float mps,elap;
int val1,val2; //values from sensors. 

void setup() 
{
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(sens1,INPUT);
  pinMode(sens2,INPUT);

//**************************** this sets up the excel sheet and ready the conection 
Serial.begin(9600); // the bigger number the better
Serial.println("CLEARDATA"); //clears up any data 
Serial.println("LABEL,Tid,Tiden Siden Start,Data"); //sets up the labels in excel
Serial.println("RESETTIMER"); //sets data time to 0 
//***************************
}

void loop() 
{
  // begining of loop
  Serial.print("DATA,TIME,TIMER,"); //writes the time in the first column A and the time since the measurements started in column B
  //Serial.print("venter");
  val1 = analogRead(sens1);
  val2 = analogRead(sens2);
  
  //**********************************loop while greater than threshold 
  while(val1 >= thresh)
  {
    val1 = analogRead(sens1);
  }
  //**********************************loop while less than threshold 
  while(val1 <= thresh)
  {
    Time=micros();
    val1 = analogRead(sens1);
  }
  //*********************************loop while greater than threshold 
  while(val2 >= thresh)
  {
    val2= analogRead(sens2);
  }
  //*********************************loop while less than threshold 
 while(val2 <= thresh)
 {
  Time2 = micros();
  val2 = analogRead(sens2);
 }
 //******************************** calculate velocity 
 
elap = Time2-Time;
mps = 120000/elap;// micrometer divide by microsec gives velocity in micrometer/microsec = m/s 

Serial.print(mps); //writes the velocity in excel
Serial.println(); // skips to next row 
}
//end of loop
